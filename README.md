# aws-lambda-uk-news-scraper

A scheduled web scraping lambda that retrieves UK news media headlines, along with tags, authors, and other metadata, on a 2-hourly basis, and saves to DynamoDb. Proof-of-concept lambda tested with the Guardian web pages.

The project also includes three other Lambdas for basic GET requests to interact with the data.

Made with NodeJS14.x, AWS Lambda, DynamoDb, Apigateway, Puppeteer, deployed using SAM.
